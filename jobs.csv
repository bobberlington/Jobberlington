Astranis is on a mission to bridge the digital divide by connecting the four billion people worldwide who currently lack internet access. We're doing this by building the next generation of smaller, more cost-effective spacecraft to bring the world online.

As a team, we’ve launched two satellites into orbit, signed ten commercial deals worth over $1 billion in revenue, raised over $500 million from top global investors, and recruited a team of over 300 world-class engineers. We all work out of our (legendary) San Francisco office, which was once used to build ships during the World Wars.

Our satellites, which operate from geostationary orbit (GEO), weigh only 400 kg and utilize a proprietary software-defined radio payload. Each satellite can connect over two million people, and we’re very excited for the impact we’ll soon have in the Philippines, Peru, Mexico, and more!

Intelligent machines powered by AI computers that can learn, reason, and interact with people are no longer science fiction. Image recognition and speech recognition — GPU deep learning has provided the foundation for machines to learn, perceive, reason, and solve problems. The GPU started out as the engine for simulating human imagination, conjuring up the amazing virtual worlds of video games and Hollywood films. Now, Nvidia’s GPU runs deep learning algorithms, simulating human intelligence, and acts as the brain of computers, robots and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world. Just as human imagination and intelligence are linked, computer graphics and artificial intelligence come together in our architecture. Two modes of the human brain, two modes of the GPU. This may explain why Nvidia GPUs are used broadly for deep learning, and Nvidia is known as “the AI computing company.”

Consumer curiosity – we act like detectives who study consumer behavior and market dynamics to formulate opportunities and problems to solve.

Game-changing ideas – our curiosity and creativity lead to unique and exciting ideas.

Irresistible food – we are developers who translate game-changing ideas into irresistible food that consumers love.

Who Are You?

At King’s Hawaiian, we don't believe consumers are fully satisfied.

You are an initiator who is not afraid to try new ideas and methods.

Passionate – You are passionate about creating joy and shared moments for consumers with irresistible food. Your passion drives you to seek and imagine possibilities to improve irresistible food experiences in consumers' lives.

Key responsibilities:

Work on diverse innovation project teams and support the execution of innovation projects through our discovery, build, and launch phases of new products
Team with innovation project resources to help develop new product prototypes and test consumer-led hypotheses
Be obsessed with learning more about our consumers by supporting and executing consumer research and validation projects. For example, in-store studies with consumers, restaurant programs, at-home consumer studies, store performance tests, etc.
Act as a key player in research projects by writing questionnaires, analyzing data & results to identify insights, and developing presentations to illustrate consumer learnings
Utilize IRI and other market data sources to uncover and analyze market opportunities and share learnings and recommendations
Act as a general strategist on the innovation team and conduct ad hoc discovery projects as they arise
Manage multiple projects simultaneously


Skills/Experience:

2+ years of innovation, consumer insights, marketing, consulting, or strategy experience
Experience working with data analytics tools (e.g., Tableau, SPSS, Excel, etc.)
Critical thinking and problem-solving to uncover opportunities
Strong interpersonal and communication skills
Ability to work in an ambiguous and entrepreneurial environment
Dedication to continuous improvement in a dynamic environment


We offer a very generous benefits package that includes medical, dental, vision, 401(k) with match, great vacation time, discounts at our restaurants, and much more!

Pay Disclosure

At Verkada, we want to attract and retain the best employees, and compensate them in a way that appropriately and fairly values their individual contribution to the company. With that in mind, we carefully consider a number of factors to determine the appropriate starting pay for an employee, including their primary work location and an assessment of a candidate’s skills and experience, as well as market demands and internal parity. This estimate can vary based on the factors described above, so the actual starting annual base salary may be above or below this range. This estimate is also just one component of Verkada’s total rewards package. A Verkada employee may be eligible for additional forms of compensation, depending on their role, including sales incentives, discretionary bonuses, and/or equity in the company in the form of Restricted Stock Units (RSUs).

About Zipline

Do you want to change the world? Zipline is on a mission to transform the way goods move. Our aim is to solve the world’s most urgent and complex access challenges by building, manufacturing and operating the first instant delivery and logistics system that serves all humans equally, wherever they are. From powering Rwanda’s national blood delivery network and Ghana’s COVID-19 vaccine distribution, to providing on-demand home delivery for Walmart, to enabling healthcare providers to bring care directly to U.S. homes, we are transforming the way things move for businesses, governments and consumers. The technology is complex but the idea is simple: a teleportation service that delivers what you need, when you need it. Through our technology that includes robotics and autonomy, we are decarbonizing delivery, decreasing road congestion, and reducing fossil fuel consumption and air pollution, while providing equitable access to billions of people and building a more resilient global supply chain.

Join Zipline and help us to make good on our promise to build an equitable and more resilient global supply chain for billions of people.

About You And The Role

Zipline is at the forefront of a logistics revolution, using autonomous aircraft to deliver just-in-time, life-saving medical supplies on multiple continents, 7 days a week. We have completed over 200,000 deliveries; it took over 4 years to reach the first 100,000 deliveries. It took 8 months to reach the last 100,000 deliveries. Do you want to be a part of reaching 1 million life-saving deliveries in the next 2 years?

We believe access to medical care should not depend on your GPS coordinates. In service of our mission to operate at global scale, we’re growing our perception capabilities to expand quickly and safely into new products and locations, with the ultimate goal of delivering essential packages right to your doorstep. Our Autonomy team is looking for an Autonomy Data Ops Full Stack Engineer to build pipelines for curating datasets for Autonomy development and to build metrics that matter for ensuring we have the right data powering our Autonomy system.

You will be responsible for the architecture, design and development of novel perception data pipelines and annotation tooling to deliver high quality datasets aimed at solving Zipline’s critical autonomy problems
You will interface with third party vendors to support annotation and audit of our data
You will partner with software, machine learning and operations teams to capture ground truth specifications, annotation throughput and quality
You will build pipelines to curate high quality datasets including automating data subsampling, annotation, audit, visualizing and evaluating data
Raise the bar on data quality by developing methods and processes to find and correct annotation errors
You will build metrics dashboards for tracking metrics such as data downselection rate, annotation throughput, audit correction rate, and costs
You will contribute to faster annotation with novel pre-labeling pipelines and annotation tools
You will work with autonomy teams to identify shortcomings of data and help improve model accuracy by delivering better datasets


What You'll Bring

Production level experience with data ETL andcuration for ML based solutions
Deep expertise in one or more of the following areas: Data ETL, Big Data Pipelines, UI/UX for Data Annotation and Audit
AWS experience with S3, IAM, Lambda, VPC, Redshift
Strong Python and Javascript/Typescript coding skills
Strong Background in computer science: algorithms and data structures
Proficiency with databases and SQL
3+ years experience with large scale production services and/or web applications
Experience with AWS Services such as Amazon S3 EC2 EKS / Kubernetes
Strong technical communication (both written and verbal), prioritization, and time management skills


What Else You Need to Know

The starting cash range for this role is $145,000 - $185,000. Please note that this is a target, starting cash range for a candidate who meets the minimum qualifications for this role. The final cash pay for this role will depend on a variety of factors, including a specific candidate's experience, qualifications, skills, working location, and projected impact. The total compensation package for this role may also include: equity compensation; discretionary annual or performance bonuses; sales incentives; benefits such as medical, dental and vision insurance; paid time off; and more.

We value diversity at Zipline and welcome applications from those who are traditionally underrepresented in tech. If you like the sound of this position but are not sure if you are the perfect fit, please apply!","Your profile lacks explicit experience in developing novel perception data pipelines and annotation tooling, as well as with AWS services such as S3, IAM, Lambda, VPC, and Redshift. Your experience also does not align with managing data ETL for ML-based solutions. Additionally, the job demands 3+ years of large-scale production services and/or web applications experience, which is not evident in your resume.",https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQEOXgFpbA6woA/company-logo_100_100/0/1678896713739/flyzipline_logo?e=1715817600&v=beta&t=tRGwwKo8AD4t3vaLGMwv7hLw58rc6B6d1Qd0CfKlF2M,"
